# Enhanced-Software-Testing-Environment-for-Python-and-C
This project updates the TrustInn, an open-source software testing platform. We modularized and refactored the code, replacing the Tkinter GUI with a more user-friendly interface, enabling tool installations separately, and improving documentation and workflows for software testing in both Python and C languages.
